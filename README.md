# Pose Estimation Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) pose estimation model for mobile inference. It includes model quantization, inference on real images, and visualization of detected body keypoints.

The keypoints are mapped to body parts based on the COCO dataset format. This optimized model is lightweight and suitable for mobile devices with fast inference times.
